Belgaum (ISO: Bēḷagāma; also Belgaon[1] and officially known as Belagavi)[8][9] is a city in the Indian state of Karnataka located in its northern part along the Western Ghats. It is the administrative headquarters of the eponymous Belagavi division and Belagavi district. The Government of Karnataka has proposed making Belgaum the second capital of Karnataka alongside Bengaluru, hence a second state administrative building Suvarna Vidhana Soudha was inaugurated on 11 October 2012.[10]

Belgaum has been selected in first phase out of 20 cities, as one of the hundred Indian cities to be developed as a smart city under PM Narendra Modi's flagship Smart Cities Mission.[11]</p>
